# CPU-scheduling
1. SJF-CPU-scheduling
Shortest job first (SJF) or shortest job next, is a scheduling policy that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next. SJN is a non-preemptive algorithm. It is a Greedy Algorithm.
2. LJF-CPU-scheduling
Longest job first is a scheduling policy that selects the waiting process with the longest execution time to execute next.LJF is a non-preemptive algorithm.
3. FCFS-CPU-scheduling
First come first serve scheduling. In this, the process that comes first will be executed first and next process starts only after the previous gets fully executed.
